# Footer oriented web analytics based on Piwik

This is an attempt to create a general purpose, multi-tenant footer that can be easily integrated into a number of federated websites, for tracking/web analytics purposes. The analytics framework used is [Piwik](http://www.piwik.org) (open source)

The website is based on [Modern Business](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/), which is a multipurpose, full website template for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
